# What is Astroblock?

Astroblock is a simple gaming protocol that provides lightweight, composable on-chain infrastructure for games, economies, and stories to be created on top of.

## Features

- A navigable on-chain galaxy: a 10MÃ—10M onchain map of that holds stars & player positions as well as logic for player movement.

- Player movement tied to $ASTRO, the native token, which directly influences player movement speed (more on this here).

- Hooks at every star, enabling external contracts to connect directly into the map.
