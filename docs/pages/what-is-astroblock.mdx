# What is Astroblock?

Astroblock is a simple gaming protocol that provides lightweight, composable on-chain infrastructure that developers can plug into to create games, economies, and stories without rebuilding core systems from scratch.

At its foundation, Astroblock offers:

- A navigable on-chain galaxy — a 10M×10M onchain map of that holds stars positions and allows players to move around.

- Player movement tied to $ASTRO, the native token, which directly influences player movement speed (more on this here).

- Composable hooks at every star, enabling external contracts and modules to connect directly into the game world.
