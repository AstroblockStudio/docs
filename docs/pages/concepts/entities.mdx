# Entities

The galaxy map is filled with entities which are celestial objects defined by their `x` & `y` positions as well as a radius `r`. There are two entity types today, Stars & Wormholes, but we'll focus on stars for now.

## Discovery

Today, the main aim of the game is to discover new entities. Instead of just pushing them into the map in a few transactions, they've been generated offchain & players
can discover them by exploring the map and requesting a central server's signature to add them to the map.

:::note
Note: Players MUST be nearby (half the radius of the entity) to be able to add them to the map. Vicinity is checked directly onchain. (More on this later)

This is what it looks like:

A 10 milion px by 10 milion px map filled with 30k stars. As of writting 5070 stars have been discovered by players ! You can see the trail some of them are leaving. All of which is permanently onchain.

## Star NFTs

All entities are also represented onchain by a ERC721 tokens that are all stored in the map contract for now. You can see the tokens being minted as they are added to the map in the game, in the OpenSea collection.
