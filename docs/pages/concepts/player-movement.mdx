# Player Movement

The Astroblock Map smart contract tracks all players in a 2D grid using simple `x` & `y` coordinates.

## How Movement Works

Players can move around the galaxy by calling the `move()` method on the map contract. When a player calls this method:

- Their position is updated on the map
- An `arrivalTime` is calculated based on their **speed** (which depends on fuel deposits, see next section)

## Real-time Tracking

The `arrivalTime` system allows for:
- **Position interpolation** - calculating where a player is between their previous and new position
- **Motion detection** - checking if a player is currently moving
- **Smooth gameplay** - players appear to move continuously rather than teleporting

This creates a dynamic, living galaxy where players are constantly in motion across the map.
