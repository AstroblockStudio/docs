# Player Movement

The Astroblock Map smart contract tracks all players in a 2D grid using simple `x` & `y` coordinates.

## How Movement Works

Players can move around the galaxy by calling the `move()` method on the map contract. When a player calls this method:

- Their position is updated on the map
- An `arrivalTime` is calculated based on their speed
- The system can track their real-time position during transit
- You can check if a player is in motion by comparing timestamps

## Real-time Tracking

The `arrivalTime` system allows for:
- **Position interpolation** - calculating where a player is between their previous and new position
- **Motion detection** - checking if a player is currently moving
- **Smooth gameplay** - players appear to move continuously rather than teleporting

This creates a dynamic, living galaxy where players are constantly in motion across the map.
