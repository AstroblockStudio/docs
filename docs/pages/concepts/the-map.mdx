# The Galaxy Map

The Astroblock Map smart contract is the core piece of infrastructure that powers the Astroblock galaxy. It manages the 2D coordinate system, player positions, and all the celestial objects within the galaxy.


## Entities

The galaxy map is also filled with entities which are celestial objects defined by their `x` & `y` positions as well as a radius `r`.
