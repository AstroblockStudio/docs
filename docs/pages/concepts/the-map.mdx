# The Galaxy Map

The **AstroblockMap** smart contract is the core of how the galaxy works. It holds all logic for the galaxy so far. It holds:
- it's own configuration (see below)
- player positions
- entities

## Configuration

The map is completely configurable from the game size, fuel token, speed factors, etc. Some concepts will make sense in the following sections.

| Name | Unit  | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `width` | `uint120` | The width of the map |
| `height` | `uint120` | The height of the map |
| `baseStarMetadataURI` | `string` | "" | The base metadata URI for the stars |
| `burnAddress` | `address` | The address that will receive the burned tokens |
| `baseSpeed` | `uint256` | The base speed |
| `burningFactor` | `uint256` | The burning factor |
| `holdingFactor` | `uint256` | The holding factor |
