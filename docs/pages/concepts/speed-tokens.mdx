# Speed & Fuel

Players can influence their movement speed by depositing \$ASTRO tokens into the map contract using the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.

## How Speed Works

The speed calculation depends on **3 factors** from the map configuration:

1. <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">$$\textcolor{blue}{s_0}$$</span> = **base speed** of the map
2. <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">$$\textcolor{red}{f_b}$$</span> = **burning factor** (multiplier for burned tokens)
3. <span className="text-green-600 font-bold">$$\textcolor{green}{f_h}$$</span> = **holding factor** (multiplier for held tokens)

## The Speed Formula

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center justify-center border p-2 bg-blue-500/20">
<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl">
$$\text{speed} = \textcolor{blue}{s_0} + \textcolor{red}{f_b} \cdot \ln(1 + b) + \textcolor{green}{f_h} \cdot \log_2(1 + h)$$
</p>
</div>

**Where:**
- $$h$$ = *amount of tokens staked by the player*
- $$b$$ = *amount of tokens burned by the player (for a single move)*

## Strategy

This design encourages both long-term holding and active burning while keeping the system simple, fair and strategic.

TL;DR: hold and/or burn to move faster.

The burned tokens come directly from the player's map deposit

## Token Mechanics

- **Holding** tokens gives you a passive speed bonus that scales logarithmically
- **Burning** tokens gives you an immediate speed boost for that specific move with diminishing returns
- **No speed cap** - more burn = more speed (just less efficient over time)
- **Strategic depth** - players must balance between holding for passive benefits and burning for immediate gains
